        letter-spacing: 2px;"><b>1. Introduction.</b> Nearly all 5050 Crowd Funding campaigns are accurate and funds are delivered and 
            used for their stated purpose. In the rare occurrence of misuse, the 5050 Crowd
             Funding Guarantee (the “Guarantee” or “Policy”) ensures that donations are protected if 
             campaign funds are not delivered to the intended beneficiary or donors are misled by a 
             campaign organizer or beneficiary. Most conflicts are not actual misuses of the 5050 Crowd 
             Funding Platform, and campaign organizers work to answer questions and resolve donors’ and beneficiaries’ concerns quickly.
             But if your concern is not sufficiently addressed, then we are here to help.</p>
        <p style="
        text-indent: 50px;
        text-align: justify;
        letter-spacing: 2px;"><b>2. For Donors.</b> Donors may receive a refund (or other resolution as described below) when they donate to a Covered Campaign and the campaign organizer or beneficiary (if one exists) of the Covered Campaign commits a Misuse. “Misuse” means any of the following:

            1. The campaign organizer does not deliver funds to the Intended Beneficiary (as defined below);
            
            2. The campaign’s content is inaccurate with respect to a material fact about the campaign organizer, beneficiary, or campaign that would induce a reasonable donor to donate to the campaign; and
            
            3. The campaign organizer or beneficiary is formally charged with a crime directly related to their actions, omissions, and/or misrepresentations made by that individual in the campaign.
            
            In the event of a Misuse, as determined in our sole discretion, we agree to reimburse you the number of your donations (up to $1000 per donor per campaign) paid by you through the Platform. In some circumstances, we may provide refunds by a credit redeemable for a donation of the same amount to another campaign. If the Misuse arose from a failed delivery of funds to the Intended Beneficiary, we may also redirect your donation to the Intended Beneficiary; please see Section 3 “For Beneficiaries,” below, for details.
            
            All resolutions are decided by 5050 Crowd Funding in our sole discretion, and all of our determinations are final.
            
            Donor Exclusions. The following reasons for a refund are excluded and not covered by this Policy:
            
            1. Seeking a refund for your donation to your own campaign;
            2. Refunds for offline donations not transacted on the Platform;
            3. Remorse;
            4. A personal disagreement with or dislike of the campaign organizer or beneficiary;
            5. Disagreement with how a campaign organizer or beneficiary uses funds raised in excess of the stated campaign goal at the time of your donation;
            6. Disagreement over the payment instrument or means by which the campaign organizer or Intended Beneficiary will receive the campaign funds;
            7. Disagreement with 5050 Crowd Funding for any reason; or8. Any reason not based on the honestly-held belief based on presentable information that a Misuse has occurred.
            
            You may be able to receive a refund in some instances even if you do not qualify for benefits under this Policy. Please contact 5050 Crowd Funding with questions.</p>     
        <p style="
        text-indent: 50px;
        text-align: justify;
        letter-spacing: 2px;"><b>3. For Beneficiaries.</b> You may qualify for a contribution from 5050 Crowd Funding when you are the Intended Beneficiary of a Covered Campaign, a Misuse occurs whereby the campaign organizer fails to deliver to you the funds raised by the Covered Campaign, and no exclusion exists as described below.

            In the event of a Misuse, as determined in our sole discretion, we agree to contribute the undelivered balance of funds on your behalf (up to $25,000 per beneficiary), exclusive of offline donations. In some circumstances, we may provide refunds to donors in lieu of providing you with payment, either in part or total. All resolutions are decided by 5050 Crowd Funding in our sole discretion, and all of our determinations are final.

           text-align: justify;
           letter-spacing: 2px;"><b>Beneficiary Exclusions.</b> The following situations are excluded and do not give rise to benefits under this Policy:
            
            1. Not receiving funds due to garnishment or other withholding or transfer of campaign funds under a court or other legal order;
            2. 5050 Crowd Funding’s decision to designate a different person as the Intended Beneficiary for benefits under this Policy;
            3. Disagreement over the payment instrument or channel in which you will receive your funds (for example, a trust or college savings plan instead of cash, or a check instead of electronic bank transfer);
            4. Your receipt of at least $25,000 in contributions from 5050 Crowd Funding under this Policy in the prior 12 months;
            5. Campaigns where you did not incur the expenses for which the campaign was intended to reimburse (for example, if you did not incur the funeral/burial expenses); and
            6. Your written authorization for 5050 Crowd Funding and it’s payment partners to allow somebody else (including the campaign organizer) to withdraw funds on your behalf.</p>
