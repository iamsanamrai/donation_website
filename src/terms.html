        <h3><b>Date of Last Revision: May 22, 2019</b></h3>
        <p style="text-indent: 50px;text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px;"><b>5050 Crowd Funding Inc.</b> provides its services (described below) to you through its website and mobile applications (the “Platform”) and related services (collectively, such services, including any new features and applications, and the Platform, the “Services”), subject to the following Terms of Service (as amended from time to time, the “Terms of Service”). If you are a campaign organizer (as defined below) you will be contracting with 50/50 Fast Funding Inc. For purposes of the following Terms of Service, “5050 Crowd Funding,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and other similar terms, shall refer to the party with whom you are contracting. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these Terms of Service at any time. If we do this, we will post the changes on this page and will indicate the date these terms were last revised. We will also endeavor to notify you, either through the Services user interface, in an email notification or through other reasonable means, and unless otherwise stated, 5050 Crowd Funding may communicate with you officially by any reasonable means now known or later developed. These currently include email, regular mail, and postings on the Platform. Any such changes will become effective no earlier than fourteen (14) days after they are posted, except that (i) changes addressing new functions of the Services or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately, and (ii) changes or modifications to the provisions of these Terms of Service governing Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration. shall be made as specified therein. Your continued use of the Services after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not wish to accept the new Terms of Service, you may discontinue your use of the Services.

            <br><br>In addition, when using certain services, you will be subject to any additional terms applicable to such services that may be posted on the Services from time to time, including, without limitation, the Privacy Policy located at https://G1R4.link/page.php?id=privacy and the 5050 Crowd Funding Guarantee Policy located at https://G1R4.link/page.php?id=guarantee. All such terms are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service (provided, however, that such other terms may be modified in accordance with their terms and, with respect to the use of the Services, these Terms of Service will take precedence in the event of a conflict).
            
           <br><br> Finally, we encourage you, particularly if you intend to donate to a 5050 Crowd Funding campaign, to review the Fees section of these Terms of Service.</p>
           <br><br><b>Access and Use of the Services</b>
           <br><br>

           <b>Services Description:</b> The Services are offered as a platform to users of the Services, which may include Campaign Organizers and Donors (each defined herein) and other registered users of the Services (which may include users who simply “like” Campaigns or otherwise interact with the Platform or Services). Among other features, the Services are designed to allow a user (a “Campaign Organizer”) to post a fundraising campaign (“Campaign”) to the Platform to accept monetary donations (“Donations”) from those registered users wishing to contribute funds to the Campaign (“Donors”). For purposes hereof, the term “Campaign Organizer” shall also be deemed to include any individual(s) designated as a beneficiary of a Campaign. Although there are no fees to set up a Campaign, a percentage of each Donation will be charged as fees for our Services. Please see our Fees section for details.
           <br><br>
           <b>Charitable Giving:</b> Campaigns are not charities to which you can make tax-deductible charitable contributions. However, in addition to the Services described above, 5050 Crowd Funding permits Donors to contribute directly to certain charitable organizations (“Charities”) through the Platform. Any donation you make to a Charity through the Platform will be subject to a Services fee as described at http://G1R4.link/page.php?id=pricing. You understand and acknowledge, however, that 5050 Crowd Funding is not a charity. If you or your charity would like to register to be listed as a charitable organization on the Platform, please contact us at [email protected] and we can help facilitate that process. As used in this Agreement, the term “Campaign” does not refer to a Charity, and you acknowledge that contributions to Campaigns are not deductible under your jurisdiction’s applicable tax laws and regulations.
           <br><br>
           <b>Services are a Platform:</b> We are not a Broker, Financial Institution, Creditor or Charitable Institution: The Services are an administrative platform only. 5050 Crowd Funding facilitates the Donation transaction between Campaign Organizers and Donors but is not a party to any agreement between a Campaign Organizer and a Donor, or between any user and a Charity. 5050 Crowd Funding is not a broker, agent, financial institution, creditor or insurer for any user. 5050 Crowd Funding has no control over the conduct of, or any information provided by, a Campaign Organizer or a Charity, and 5050 Crowd Funding hereby disclaims all liability in this regard to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
           
           5050 Crowd Funding does not guarantee that a Campaign or a Charity will obtain a certain amount of Donations or any Donations at all. We do not personally endorse any Campaign, Campaign Organizer, or Charity, and we make no guarantee, explicit or implied, that any information provided through the Services by a user is accurate. We expressly disclaim any liability or responsibility for the success of any Campaign, or the outcome of any fundraising purpose. You, as a Donor, must make the final determination as to the value and appropriateness of contributing to any Campaign, Campaign Organizer, or Charity.
